# cpp-math-library

This library is a collection of voids for C++ that allow for calculations without an external header file.
Mostly created for fun and to test my ability to do math inside of a programing language without the build in calculations.
In the future I would like to create a table of contents for the functions available but my standard is to name the void what it is.
